# Targeted-MNase-seq-analysis
Analysis pipeline for targeted MNase-seq.

This pipeline aims to analyze nucleosome positioning at individual loci from mapped paired-end MNase-seq data. The input files are locus-specific BAM files.
_FLC_ gene-specific BAM files for wild-type after cold are provided and can be used to test the pipeline.
In the end, a plot for the entire FLC locus is generated.
For additional information see the paper (_currently unpublished_)
